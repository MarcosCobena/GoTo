# GoTo

This' a program written in GOTO, would you guess its goal?

```
[A] X = X - 1
Y = Y + 1
IF X != 0 GOTO A
```

Exactly! It "copies" the input value in X right into Y, that simple.

What are you able to write with the [language](https://github.com/MarcosCobena/GoTo/wiki/Language)? You have the following choices:
1. jump in directly from your browser with [GoTo Studio](https://marcoscobena.com/goto-studio/),
2. add [![GoTo](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/GoTo.svg?label=GoTo)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/GoTo) to your project and consume the framework as a service, or
3. build GoTo.CLI project by your-self for a quick command-line compiler
